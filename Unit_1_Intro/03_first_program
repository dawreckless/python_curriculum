In the editor, type this:

name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", name)

After you have typed this, save the file with ctrl + s

Naming Files
When naming files, follow these general rules:
1. End it with .py
2. All lowercase
3. No spaces
4. Describes the program

Good Examples:
example.py
rocket_launch.py
basic_calculator.py

Bad Examples: 
test!!!.python
example (1).py
My Game.py

Click "Run" -> "Run Module"

Congrats! You have made your first program
(The code will be explained later, don't worry)
