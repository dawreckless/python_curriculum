# Unit 5 - Lists and Dictionaries

## What are Lists and Dictionaries?

### Lists

Lists store collections of data that are ordered, are able to be changed, and allow duplicates.

Example: 
animals = ["Dog","Cat","Fish","Bird","Cow"]

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs that are ordered and changable, but duplicates are not allowed.

Example:
student_info = {

  "name":"Bobby",
  
  "age":16,
  
  is_male:True,
  
  "gpa":3.7,
  
}

## Why do we need Lists and Dictionaries?

Lists help you store many similar values into one variable.

Dictionaries help you store named information.

Together, they make code much faster and easier to read and use.
