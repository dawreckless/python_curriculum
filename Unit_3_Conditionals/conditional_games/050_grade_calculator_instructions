## Grade Calculator

Create a program that asks the user for their test score and prints their letter grade.

### Steps:
1. Ask the user to enter a score between 0 and 100.
2. Convert their input into a number.
3. Use if/elif/else to decide the letter grade:
   - 90–100 → A
   - 80–89 → B
   - 70–79 → C
   - 60–69 → D
   - 0–59  → F
4. If the score is above 100 or below 0, print an error message.
5. Otherwise, print the final grade.

### Example:
Enter score: 87  
Your grade is: B
