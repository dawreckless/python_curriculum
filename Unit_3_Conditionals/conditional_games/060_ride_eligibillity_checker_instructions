## Ride Eligibility Checker

Create a program that asks the user for their height and age, then decides if they can ride a theme-park roller coaster. This project practices the logical operators **and**, **or**, and **not**.

### Steps:
1. Ask the user for their height in feet.
2. Ask the user for their age.
3. Use conditionals to check:
   - If height is at least 4 feet **and** age is at least 10 → they can ride.
   - If height is at least 4 feet **or** age is at least 10 → they can ride with adult supervision.
   - If the user is **not** tall enough (height < 4) → they cannot ride.
4. Print the correct message based on the conditions.

### Example:
```
Enter height: 4.2
Enter age: 8
You can ride with adult supervision.
```
