## Basic Calculator

Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.

### Steps: 
1. Ask the user for the first number  
2. Ask the user for the second number  
3. Ask the user which operation they want to use (+, -, *, /)  
4. Use if/elif/else statements to decide which operation to perform  
5. Do the calculation and print the result  
6. If the user tries to divide by zero, display an error message  
7. If the user enters an invalid operation, print "Invalid operation"

### Example:
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): *

Result: 30
```
