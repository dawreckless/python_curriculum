# Python Curriculum 

Welcome to the begineer Python Curriculum!

## How to teach this curriculum
This curriculum is specifically designed for teachers, but can be used by students.
Each section with 2 numbers (Ex. 03) is not a game, it is an introduction to a concept.
Each section with 3 numbers (Ex. 040) is a mini-game with instructions and the code. 

## Values
This course values learning and understanding instead of copying code
In this course, I would rather have student make less games but understand them fully,
instead of making 100 games but just copying them from an instructor.

## Units
1. Introduction to Python
2. Variables & Data Types
3. Conditionals
4. Loops
5. Lists & Dictionaries
6. Functions
