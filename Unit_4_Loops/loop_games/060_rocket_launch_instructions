## Rocket Launch Simulator

Create a program where the user must enter the correct passcode to launch a rocket.  
If they enter the wrong passcode, they must try again.

### What You Must Use:
- Variables  
- Conditionals  
- While loops  
- For loops (for the countdown)  
- `break` (to cancel the launch)  
- `continue` (for invalid/empty input)

### Steps:
1. Start with a secret passcode (any number you want).
2. Ask the user to type the passcode.
3. If they type "cancel", stop the game using `break`.
4. If they type something that is NOT a number, use `continue`.
5. If the passcode is wrong, ask again.
6. When the passcode is correct, print a countdown from 5 to 1 using a **for loop**.
7. After the countdown, print **"LAUNCH! 🚀"**

### Example:
```
Enter passcode: abc
Invalid input.
Enter passcode: 123
Wrong passcode.
Enter passcode: 999
Correct!

5

3
2
1
LAUNCH! 🚀
```

Hint?
              
if not guess.isdigit(): 
        print("Invalid input.")
        continue
