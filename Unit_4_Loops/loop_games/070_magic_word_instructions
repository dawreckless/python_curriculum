## Magic Word Gate

Create a program where the user must type the correct magic word to open a gate.

### What You Will Use:
- Variables  
- While loop  
- Conditionals  
- `break` and `continue`

### Steps:
1. Start with a secret magic word.
2. Ask the user to type a word.
3. If the user types nothing (empty input), use `continue` to ask again.
4. If the user types "quit", use `break` to end the game.
5. If the user types the wrong word, say "Wrong!" and ask again.
6. If the user types the correct magic word, say "Gate opened!" and stop the loop.

### Example:
```
Say the magic word: hi
Wrong!
Say the magic word: 
(continue)
Say the magic word: open
Gate opened!
```
