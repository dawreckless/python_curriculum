# Unit 4 — Loops

## What Are Loops?
Loops let your program repeat actions without rewriting code.  
Instead of typing something 10 times, you can use a loop to do it automatically.

## Why Do We Use Loops?
Loops make your programs:
- Faster to write  
- Easier to read  
- More powerful  
- Able to repeat tasks automatically
  
Python has two main types of loops:
- **while loops** — repeat as long as a condition is true  
- **for loops** — repeat a set number of times or go through items in a sequence  

Games use loops constantly for:
- Counting down timers  
- Repeating turns  
- Moving enemies  
- Checking for game-over conditions  

## Types of Loops You Will Learn
- while loops  
- for loops  
- break (stop a loop)  
- continue (skip a loop step)
