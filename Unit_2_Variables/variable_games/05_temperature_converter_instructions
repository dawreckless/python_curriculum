## Final Project — Temperature Converter

Create a program that asks the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit, converts it to Celsius, and prints the result.

Formula:
C = (F - 32) * (5/9)

The program should:
- Ask for input
- Convert the input into a float
- Do the math
- Display the temperature in both units
